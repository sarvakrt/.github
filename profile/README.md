# Item Tracking System - Microservices Architecture

Welcome to the Item Tracking System, a microservices-based application designed to efficiently manage and track the location of items within a given environment.
Every User needs to be most disiplined. this Application helps to create exactly that.

<!-- TOC --><a name="project-overview"></a>
## Project Overview

The Item Tracking System employs a microservices architecture to enhance modularity, scalability, and maintainability. Each microservice focuses on specific business capabilities, and they communicate through well-defined APIs.

<!-- TOC --><a name="microservices-components"></a>
## Microservices Components

<!-- TOC --><a name="1-item-service"></a>
### 1. Item Service
- Manages information about items.
- Provides endpoints for item creation, retrieval, update, and deletion.

<!-- TOC --><a name="2-location-service"></a>
### 2. Location Service
- Manages information about locations.
- Provides endpoints for location creation, retrieval, update, and deletion.

<!-- TOC --><a name="3-audit-service"></a>
### 3. Audit Service
- Handles the auditing process.
- Provides endpoints for creating and retrieving audit records.

<!-- TOC --><a name="service-communication"></a>
## Service Communication

- Microservices communicate through well-defined APIs.
- RESTful APIs are used for simplicity and ease of integration.
- An API gateway manages external communication, enforces security, and handles routing.

<!-- TOC --><a name="database-per-service"></a>
## Database Per Service

- Each microservice has its own dedicated database.
- Ensures data autonomy and independence for each service.
- Database choices align with the specific needs of each service (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB).

<!-- TOC --><a name="data-consistency"></a>
## Data Consistency

- Eventual consistency models are implemented for data across microservices.
- Distributed transactions are used sparingly, compensating transactions for consistency.

<!-- TOC --><a name="service-discovery"></a>
## Service Discovery

- Service discovery mechanisms are employed to enable dynamic communication between microservices.
- Tools such as Consul, Eureka, or Kubernetes service discovery can be utilized.

<!-- TOC --><a name="api-gateway"></a>
## API Gateway

- An API gateway is implemented to provide a single entry point for external clients.
- Manages authentication, routing, security, rate limiting, and other API-related concerns.

<!-- TOC --><a name="containerization-and-orchestration"></a>
## Containerization and Orchestration

- Microservices are containerized using Docker.
- Orchestration is handled by Kubernetes, providing simplified deployment, scaling, and management.

<!-- TOC --><a name="load-balancing"></a>
## Load Balancing

- Load balancing distributes incoming traffic among multiple instances of each microservice.
- Improves scalability, availability, and fault tolerance.

<!-- TOC --><a name="monitoring-and-logging"></a>
## Monitoring and Logging

- Comprehensive monitoring and logging are implemented for each microservice.
- Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) are used for centralized monitoring and logging.

<!-- TOC --><a name="security"></a>
## Security

- Robust security measures, including authentication and authorization, are implemented for each microservice.
- Secure communication is ensured using HTTPS or other secure protocols.

<!-- TOC --><a name="continuous-integrationcontinuous-deployment-cicd"></a>
## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- CI/CD pipelines are established for automated testing, building, and deployment of microservices.
- Tools such as Jenkins, GitLab CI, or Travis CI are employed.

<!-- TOC --><a name="documentation"></a>
## Documentation

- Comprehensive documentation is provided for each microservice.
- Includes API documentation, deployment guides, and troubleshooting information.

<!-- TOC --><a name="team-structure"></a>
## Team Structure

- Development teams are organized around microservices.
- Each team owns, develops, and maintains specific services.
- Encourages communication and collaboration between teams.

<!-- TOC --><a name="versioning"></a>
## Versioning

- API versioning strategies are implemented to manage changes without breaking existing clients.
- Semantic versioning (e.g., v1, v2) is utilized.

<!-- TOC --><a name="scaling"></a>
## Scaling

- Microservices can be scaled independently based on demand.
- Auto-scaling mechanisms are considered to handle variable workloads.

<!-- TOC --><a name="fault-tolerance-and-resilience"></a>
## Fault Tolerance and Resilience

- Microservices are designed to be resilient to failures in other services.
- Circuit breakers and fallback mechanisms are implemented.
