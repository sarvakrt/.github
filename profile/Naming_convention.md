# Naming Conventions in Coding

## 1. Variables

- Use descriptive names that convey the purpose or content of the variable.
- Start with a lowercase letter and use camelCase for multi-word names (e.g., `itemCount`, `userName`).
- For constants, use uppercase letters with underscores for spaces (e.g., `MAX_VALUE`, `PI`).

## 2. Functions and Methods

- Use descriptive verbs or verb phrases to convey the action performed by the function.
- Start with a lowercase letter and use camelCase for multi-word names (e.g., `calculateTotal`, `getUserInfo`).
- Follow the principle of "do one thing well" â€” a function should have a single responsibility.

## 3. Classes

- Use nouns or noun phrases to represent objects or entities.
- Start with an uppercase letter and use CamelCase for multi-word names (e.g., `Car`, `UserProfile`).
- Consider following the [PascalCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case#PascalCase) convention.

## 4. Constants

- Use uppercase letters with underscores for spaces between words (e.g., `MAX_FILE_SIZE`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`).
- Constants are often declared at the top of a file or in a dedicated module.

## 5. Modules and Packages

- Use short, lowercase names for modules (e.g., `utils.py`, `math_operations.py`).
- Avoid naming conflicts by choosing unique names.

## 6. Arguments and Parameters

- Use descriptive names that convey the purpose of the parameter.
- Keep the names concise but meaningful (e.g., `firstName`, `maxValue`).

## 7. Booleans

- Use names that suggest a condition or a state.
- Prefix with "is," "has," or another appropriate verb (e.g., `isActive`, `hasPermission`).

## 8. Acronyms

- Treat acronyms as words (e.g., `htmlParser`, not `HTMLParser`).
- Exception: When an acronym is the first word in a camelCase identifier or the first or last word in a snake_case identifier, capitalize it (e.g., `XMLHttpRequest`, `http_response_code`).

## 9. Enumeration Types

- Use singular names for enumeration types (enums) and use uppercase letters (e.g., `Color.RED`, `DayOfWeek.MONDAY`).
- Enum values are usually uppercase.

## 10. Identifiers with a Single Character

- Generally, avoid single-character variable names except for simple loop counters (e.g., `i`, `j`).
- Use meaningful names for variables with broader scopes.

## 11. Comments

- Write comments for code sections that are not immediately clear.
- Keep comments concise and up-to-date.
- Avoid redundant comments that merely repeat the code.

## 12. Consistency

- Be consistent within a codebase. Follow the established naming conventions.
- If working on a team, agree on a set of conventions to maintain a uniform coding style.

### Examples in Python

```python
# Variables
item_count = 10
user_name = "John Doe"

# Functions
def calculate_total(price, quantity):
    return price * quantity

# Classes
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

# Constants
MAX_VALUE = 100
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 30

# Modules
import utils
import math_operations

# Boolean
is_active = True
has_permission = False

# Arguments and Parameters
def greet_user(first_name, last_name):
    return f"Hello, {first_name} {last_name}!"

# Enumeration Types
class Color:
    RED = "red"
    GREEN = "green"
    BLUE = "blue"

class DayOfWeek:
    MONDAY = 1
    TUESDAY = 2

# Acronyms
html_parser = HTMLParser()
http_response_code = 200

# Single Character (for simple loop counters)
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# Comments
# This is a comment explaining the purpose of the following code.
result = calculate_total(20, 3)
